# testGame
This is a project I started and worked on around 2017-2018. As I was first learning Java, I decided to create a game using the native Java libraries. 
Its mechanics are very basic, just a square moving around, dodging enemies and collecting coins, but it really gave me a grasp of how programming
could be used to create a bigger project from the ground up.
